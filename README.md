About
=====
BleuFear is a theme (technically a collection of themes) with a wild 
streak of electric blue. It is inspired by the design of my site and 
everything else that fits that color scheme. The name comes from the 
french word for blue(duh) and the way Americans pronounce the first part 
of my last name. (Also, it's a dark theme so fear~=dark).

It seems very derived right now (because it is). I'm still in the 
process of changing a lot of things.
